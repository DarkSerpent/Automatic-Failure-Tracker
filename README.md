# Automatic Failure Tracker
> A module which tracks whether an Automatic Failure is rolled in the Sword World 2.5 system (and outputs a message in chat if it is)
## Additional Notes
* If the player is a GM, it will output the name of the token they have selected. If they are not selecting any tokens, it outputs the GM's username.
* If the player is not a GM, it will output the name of the sheet they have assigned in their User Configuration. If no sheet is assigned, it outputs the player's username.
